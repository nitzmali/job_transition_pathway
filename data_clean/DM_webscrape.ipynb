      "description <p>Interested in the field of Machine Learning?&nbsp;Then this course is for you!</p><p>This course has been designed by a <strong>Data Scientist and a Machine Learning expert</strong> so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory,&nbsp;algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.</p><p><strong>Over 900,000 students</strong> world-wide trust this course.</p><p>We will walk you step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial, you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.</p><p>This course can be completed by either doing either the <strong>Python tutorials, or R tutorials,</strong> or both -&nbsp;Python &amp;&nbsp;R. Pick the programming language that you need for your career.</p><p>This course is&nbsp;fun and exciting, and at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:</p><ul><li><p>Part 1 - Data Preprocessing</p></li><li><p>Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression,&nbsp;Polynomial&nbsp;Regression,&nbsp;SVR, Decision Tree Regression,&nbsp;Random Forest Regression</p></li><li><p>Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification,&nbsp;Random&nbsp;Forest Classification</p></li><li><p>Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means,&nbsp;Hierarchical Clustering</p></li><li><p>Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori,&nbsp;Eclat</p></li><li><p>Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning:&nbsp;Upper Confidence Bound,&nbsp;Thompson Sampling</p></li><li><p>Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model&nbsp;and&nbsp;algorithms for NLP</p></li><li><p>Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks,&nbsp;Convolutional Neural Networks</p></li><li><p>Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA</p></li><li><p>Part 10 - Model Selection &amp; Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search,&nbsp;XGBoost</p></li></ul><p>Each section inside each part is independent. So you can either take the whole course from start to finish or you can jump right into any specific section and <strong>learn what you need for your career right now</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on <strong>real-life&nbsp;case studies</strong>. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get lots of <strong>hands-on practice</strong> building your own models.</p><p>And as a bonus, this course <strong>includes both&nbsp;Python and R&nbsp;code templates </strong>which you can download and use on your own projects.</p>\n",
